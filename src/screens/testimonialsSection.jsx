                "I found Eden Utilities to be very professional and helpful.
                They fully analysed each supplier offer provided to them on our
                behalf, and clearly explained through all the options available
                to us, meaning our workload and decision making was made much
                easier. They were also able to obtain prices, for both our
                electricity and gas contracts, that we could not have gained
                directly via an energy supplier, and provided the Chamber with
                some significant savings on our energy spend. I can highly
                recommend working with them."

                closely with them, Eden Utilities has helped Biffa gain
                significant savings, through the introduction of their knowledge
                and specialist understanding of the energy industry, energy
                supplies and our business. I have been very impressed by the
                professionalism and ethics of Eden Utilities. Their experience
                and expertise is exceptional, and I would not hesitate in
                recommending them to any other company."
